 of jove of any source that you know them
 he said this with all good will but he did not listen and now he hes paid for everything
 so mad at him
  and jupiter said my daughter what are you talking about
 the oxen they had killed and eaten and playing the the front of the house
  telemachus saw her long before anyone else
 he took his right hand in his and ordered him to give him his spear
 welcome he said to our house and when you have eaten food you will tell us why you have come
  he led the way as he spoke and minerva followed
  then the suitors entered and took their place on the benches and seating
 to sing telmaco spoke low to minerva with his head near his own that no man could hear
 where you come from
 this house or have you been here in my fathers time
 days that we had many visitors because my father was much by himself 
  and minerva replied i will tell you truly and in particular to all about it
 away from the city in the port rheithron under the wooded mountain neritum
 you if you are going to ask him
 such an elegant guy for a son
 weve never seen either of them
 true what is the meaning of all this banquet and who are these people
 marriage in the family  because nobody seems to be bringing any provision of your own
  is that so
 home again
 then coming from ephyra where he had been begging venom for his arrows of ilus son of mermerus
 i did not give him anything but my father let him have something because he was very sweetie
 they have a short shrift and a shabby wedding
 my advice call the achaean heroes at the assembly tomorrow
 before them and call to heaven to bear witness
 how by right or wrong means you can kill these suitors in your own home
 how people are singing the praises of orestes for having killed his father assassin aegisthus
 mettle then and make a name in history
  minerva replied do not try to keep me because i would be in my way right away
 until she comes back and ill take her with me
 i am very good and i will give you one of no less value in return
 strange had been a god so went straight to where the suitors they were sitting
  phemius continued to sing and his listeners sat in silence
 he told the sad story of the return of troy and the evils of minerva he had put on the achaians
 song from his room upstairs and down the grand staircase not only but assisted by two of her maids
 he also had a veil in front of his face and wept bitterly
  piusius he cried you know many other deeds of gods and heroes as poets love to celebrate
 return of the danaans so that people always applaud the last songs warmer
 only the man who never returned from troy but many others came down just like him
  she was wondering again in the house and put her son saying in his heart
 she wept to her beloved husband until minerva gave her a sweet dream about her eyes
 and he begged everyone to be his bedmate
  the suitors bit their lips when they heard and marveled
 audacity of his speech
  telemachus replied antinous do not rebuke me but god willing ill be the boss too if i can
 from me its not bad to be a boss because it brings both riches and honor
 i want to know about this stranger
 what family is he and where is his estate
 news about the return of his father or was in the business of his own
 he was gone in a moment before we could meet him
 she knew she had been the goddess
 on the outside patio here then he fell meditated and full of thought
 he went before him with a pair of burning torches
 he curled his sword over his shoulder and left his room
 an immortal god
  men of ithaca he said listen to my words from the day ulysses left
 warn or talk about some other matter of public moment
 im sure hes an excellent person and i hope jove will grant him the desire of your heart 
 the assembly and the good herald pisenor brought him his staff
 my affliction is purely personal and becomes two great misfortunes they have fallen on my house
 the main men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against his will
 i respect therefore your own conscience and public opinion
 fear also the wrath of heaven that the gods may not displease and they turn upon you
  with this telemachus he knocked his cane to the ground and exploded in tears
 she is a very cunning woman
 a large frame of drums in his room and began to work on a huge thin seam piece
 the place will speak if it is lying without a cloth
 i give you this answer which you and the achaians can understand
 alcmena mycene and the famous women of antiquity but they were nothing to your mother any of them
  telemachus replied antinous how can i lead the mother who i from my fathers house
 whether he is alive or dead
 icarius the great sum that i must give if i insist on sending his daughter back to him
 then we will be wise in time and put an end to this evil before he comes
 you more
 and on his way home i will put up with the waste you will suit make for yet another twelve months
  leiocritus son of evenor answered him saying mentor what folly is this the people to stay us
 thing for one man to fight with many about his victuals
 he will be more likely to stay and tells him something
  as he thus prayed minerva came close to him in the likeness and with the voice of mentor
  thus spoke minerva daughter of jove and telemachus lost no time in doing the goddess told him
 flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court
 you should waste so much good property of mine while i was yet a boy
 thanks to you suitors i have neither ship nor crew of my own and must be passenger not captain
  as he spoke he snatched his hand from that of antinous
 the others went on getting dinner ready on the buildings jeering at him tauntingly as they did so
 ephyra as well for poison to put in our wine and kill us
  this was how they talked
 these things put together at once and say nothing about it
 i have gone upstairs i have gone upstairs for the night
 anything about the return of my dear father
 are the one hope of the house
 i want to be a foreign country
 im going to be scheming to get you out
  then minerva bethought her of another matter
 and went round the town to each one of the crew telling them to meet at the ship by sundown
 asked him to let her have a ship which he was very ready to do
 crew came up and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them
  moreover she went to the house of ulysses and threw the suitors into a deep slumber
 of mentor and called telemachus to come outside
  on this she led the way while telemachus followed in her steps
  with these words i have led the way and the others followed after
 took their places on the benches
  thus then the ship spends on her way through the watches of the night from dark till dawn
 shore to offer sacrifice of black bulls to neptune lord of the earthquake
 there were nine guilds with five hundred men in each and there were nine bulls to each guild
  minerva led the way and telemachus followed her
  but how mentor replied telemachus dare i go up to nestor and how am i to address him
 conversations with people and am ashamed to begin questioning one who is so much older than myself
 i saw the strangers crowded round them took them by the hand and bade them take their places
 hes lifts his hands in prayer for man can not live without god in the world
 i will give you the precedence
  as i spoke i handed her the cup
 proper of him to have given it to herself first she praying heartily to neptune
 the earth vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon thee
  when she had thus made an end of praying she handed the cup to telemachus and he prayed likewise
 to eat and drink nestor knight of gerene began to speak
  now said he that our guests have done their dinner it will be best to ask them who they are
 and from what port have you sailed
 the seas rovers with your hand against every man and every man hand against you
  nestor said he son of neleus honor to the achaean name you i will tell you
 neritum and the matter about which i would speak of private not public import
 to have sacked the town of troy in company with yourself
 this what mortal could indeed tell the whole story
 would not prevail with her for when the gods made up their minds they do not change them lightly
  that night we rested and nursed our anger for jove was hatching mischief against us
 other half embarked and sailed and the ships went well for heaven had smoothed the sea
 me and his crews with him
 that we should be out of danger the open sea to euboea
  therefore my dear young friend i returned without hearing anything about the others
 aegisthus the murderer aegisthus the murderer of his noble father
 fellowshow your mettle and make yourself a name in story
 are you feeling and the voice of heaven against you
  telemachus answered i would expect nothing of the kind far too much to hope for
 though the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me
  on this minerva said telemachus what are you talking about
 and when a mans hour is come not even the gods can save him no matter how fond they are of him
  mentor answered telemachus do not let us talk about it any more
 about what i should like to ask nestor for he knows much more than any one else does
 that it is like talking to an immortal
 and tell me true how did agamemnon begin to die in that way
 was menelaus doing
 a man than himself
 elsewhither among mankind that aegisthus took heart and killed agamemnon
  i will tell you truly answered nestor and indeed you have yourself divined how it all happened
  meanwhile menelaus and i were on our way home from troy on good terms with one another
 wrecked but the crews just managed to save themselves
 your own men with you would you rather travel by land
 the truth and he will tell you no lies for he is an excellent person
  thus spoke the daughter of jove and they obeyed her saying
  heaven and the immortal gods he exclaimed forbid that you should leave my house to go on a ship
 where i have a large sum of money owing to me
 now that he is his guest send him to lacedaemon in a chariot and let one of your sounds go with him
 your best and fleetest horses
  when she had thus spoken she flew away in the form of an eagle and all marvelled as they beheld it
 by the hand
 i have continued vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself my good wife and my children
 broadbrowed heifer of a year old unbroken and never yet on by man under the yoke
 to you in sacrifice
  thus did he pray and minerva heard his prayer
 to his own house followed by his sounds and soundsinlaw
 the wine he prayed much and made drinkofferings to minerva daughter of aegisbearing jove
 inner room of the house with the queen his wife by his side
  my sounds he said
 ship and invite all the crew leaving two men only in charge of the vessel
 gild the horns of the heifer
 to bring me some clear spring water
  on this they hurried off on their several errands
 lifted the heifers head from the ground and pisistratus cut her throat
  meanwhile lovely polycaste nestors youngest daughter washed telemachus
 to eat and drink nestor said sons put telemachuss horses to the chariot that he may start at once
  thus did he speak and they did even as he had said and yoked the fleet horses to the chariot
 of bread wine and sweetmeats fit for the sounds of princes
 got into the chariot while pisistratus gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him
 nothing loth into the open country leaving the high citadel of pylos behind them
 necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land
 they reached pherae where diocles lived who was they to ortilochus and grandson to alpheus
 them hospitably
 they will yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse
 he has found a bride from sparta daughter of alector
  so the neighbours and kinsmen of menelaus were feasting and making merry in his house
 we take their horses out or tell them to find friends elsewhere they best can
  so eteoneus bustled back and bade other servants come with him
 leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard and led the way into the house
 of scepterbearing kings for poor people do not have such sounds as you are
 everything is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of olympian jove
 whether master or man has plenty of cheese meat and good milk for the ewes yield all year round
 i had stayed at home and all those were living who perished on the plain of troy far from argos
 for one and all of them
 i leave off again for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of that
 them all
  thus spoke menelaus and the heart of telemachus yearned as he bethought him of his father
 so that he held his cloak before his face with both hands
 help saying what i think never yet have i seen either man or woman i really do not know what to do
  my dear wife replied menelaus i see the likeness just as you do
 the shape of his head and the expression of his eyes
 have built a city for him in argos and built him a house
 good fortune for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at all
  thus did he speak and his words set them all to weeping
 it is possible i would urge you
 i am getting my supper
 forenoon i care not how much i cry for those that are dead and gone
 this is all we can do for the poor things
 for them and wringing the tears from our cheeks
  your discretion my friend answered menelaus is beyond your years
 its plain you take after your father
 this weeping and attending our supper again
 over our hands
 the morning
  then joves daughter helen bethought her of another matter
 the wine with an herb that banishes all care sorrow and ill humor
 a skilled physician for they are of the race of paeeon
 and quite different from what he was when he was among his own people
  then menelaus said all that you have been saying my dear wife is true
 but i have never seen such another man the ulysses
 god who wished well to the trojans you had deiphobus with you
 that saved us all for he muzzled anticlus till minerva took you away again
  how sad exclaimed telemachus that all this was of no avail save him nor yet his own iron courage
 send us all to bed that we may go down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep
  when the child of morning rosyfingered dawn appeared menelaus rose and dressed himself
 girded his sword about his shoulders and left his room looking like an immortal god
  and what telemachus have you taken this long sea voyage to lacedaemon
 item
 pity for myself but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw
  menelaus on hearing this was very shocked
 these cowards would usurp the brave mans bed
 gods know everything
 i will sail the sea and i will sail
 my home    stranger replied she i will make it all clear to you
 there is an immortal who lives under the hereabouts and whose name is proteus
 he is neptunes head and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom of the sea
 a god is not easily caught by mortal man
  stranger she said i will make it all clear to you
 you and this place will ambush you
 supper ready for night was falling and camped down upon the beach
 she dug four pits for us to lie in and sat down to wait till we should come up
 one after the other and threw a seal skin over each of us
  you know that you old man i answered you will gain nothing by trying to put me off
 this island and see no sign of my being able to get away
  son of atreus he answered why do you ask me
 what i will tell you for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard my story
 of battleyou were there yourself
 at sea alive but hindered from returning
 and invited him to the feast but he meant foul play
  thus spoke proteus and i was broken hearted as i heard him
 he is dead tell me no matter how much it may grieve me
  the third man i answered is ulysses who dwells in ithaca
 happen to you because you have married helen and are joves soninlaw
 was falling and camped down upon the beach
  and now for yourself stay here some ten or twelve days longer and i will speed you on your way
 of a chariot and three horses
 that you like to drink you can drink to the immortal gods
 i would rather have you i have a piece of plate
 but you will not leave them alone
 none of our islands have much ground level suitable for horses and ithaca least of all
  menelaus smiled and took telemachuss hand within his own
 say said he shows that you eat of good family
 own hand of pure silver except the rim which is inlaid with gold
 will make you a present of it
  thus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the kings house
 only with the sheep or with the sheep the swineherd so antinous said when did you go
 what young men did they take with him
 bondsmen for he might manage that too
 he / she / it will ship your own free will i have taken it without yourleave
 i saw mentor here yesterday morning and yet he was then setting out for pylos
  noemon then went back to his fathers house but antinous and eurymachus were very angry
 eat and sit down along with themselves
 are of eupeithes spoke in anger
 giving us trouble presently may jove take him before he is full grown
 penelope said medon what have the suitors sent you here for
 their masters business and cook dinner for them
 neither woo nor dine henceforward neither here nor anywhere else im going to waste my time
 my sons estate did not you fathers tell you when you were children
 how good ulysses had been to them never doing anything highhanded nor speaking harshly to anybody
 home from pylos and lacedaemon where have you been to get news of his father
 at last however she said why did my son leave me
 had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like seahorses
 behind him to keep up his name
  then he went downstairs again leaving penelope in an agony of grief
 there were plenty of seats in the house but she
 i have not had enough
  with these words she made her mistress leave off crying and dried the tears from her eyes
 and went upstairs with her maids
 into a basket and began praying to minerva
  hear me she cried daughter of aegisbearing jove unweariable
 little does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die
  this was what they said but they did not know what was going to happen
 then antinous said comrades let there be no loud talking lest some of it gets carried inside
 about which we are all of a mind
  he then chose twenty men and they went down to theirs
 will yet come back to you
  penelope who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland answered sister why do you come here
 suppose thats because you live such a long way off
 to leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture i
  then the vision said take heart and be not so much dismayed
 here then the achaeans placed themselves in ambush
  what my dear are you talking about
  thus spoke and mercury guide and guardian slayer of argus did as he was told
 with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea
  i found her at home
 and one could smell from the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal wood
 golden shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully
 such a lovely spot so mercury was still and looked at it but when i went inside the cave
 would have me
 nevertheless i had to come for none of us other gods can cross jove nor transgress his orders
  calypso trembled with rage when she heard this you gods she exclaimed to be ashamed of yourselves
 i have a man here
  my poor fellow you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your life out any longer
 bread wine and water on board to save you from starving
  ulysses shuddered as he heard her
 straightforwardly my heart is not made of iron and i am very sorry for you
  goddess replied ulysses do not be angry with me about this
 penelope is nothing like so tall or so beautiful as yourself
 nevertheless i want to get home and can think of nothing else
 some god wrecks me when i am on the sea i will bear it and make the best of it
 so let this go with the rest
 to think how she could speed ulysses on his way
 calypso went home leaving him to cut them which he soon finished doing
 them by rule in good workmanlike fashion
 with a yard arm and a rudder to steer with
 round with wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves and then he threw on a quantity of wood
 linen to make the sails and have made these too excellently making them fast with braces and sheets
 i drew the raft down into the water
 he shall have plenty of hardship before he has done it
 hes all at the same time and a tremendous sea got up so that ulysses heart began to fail him
 calypso was right when she i got back home
 coming true
 what are the winds are raising from every quarter at eleven i am now safe to perish
 fell before troy in the cause of the sounds of atreus
 calypso had to be able to rise to the surface again
 in spite of all this however he did not lose sight of his raft i swam i swam i swam
 on board again so as to escape drowning
 tossed it about the autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road
 they were all playing battledore and shuttlecock with it at eleven
  my poor good man she said why is neptune so furiously angry with you
 my veil and put it round your chest it is enchanted and you can its not as long as you wear it
 take it off throw it back go away again
 he
 the dark blue waters
  but ulysses did not know what to think
 let you off too lightly
 aegae where his palace is
 he looked eagerly ahead and could see land quite near
 your suppliant
 at last ulysses knees and strong hands failed him for the sea had completely broken him
 among the rushes and kissed the bounteous earth
  alas he cried to himself in his dismay what ever will become of me and how is it all to end
 down and heaped the leaves all round him
 minerva hie in furtherance of the return of ulysses
 pretty one on either side of the doorway which was closed with wellmade folding doors
 a washing day and start at daybreak
  when she said this minerva went away to olympus which they say is the everlasting home of the gods
 she was given instructions to the girl
  papa dear could you manage to let me have a good big wagon
 to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them
 will get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold all your clothes
 mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the water side
 them in the water and vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get the dirt out
 at one of the maids which missed her and fell into deep water
  alas said he to himself what kind of people have i eat amongst
 are they cruel savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane
 try me if i can not manage to get a look at them
  o queen he said i beg your aid but tell me are you a goddess
 are you a dead woman
 yet saw any one so beautiful neither man nor woman and am lost in admiration as i behold you
 friends glad and they themselves know more about it than any one
  to this nausicaa responded stranger you appear to be a sensible welldisposed person
  then she called her maids and said stay where you are you girls
 can you see a man without running away from him
 for robber or a murderer
  on this the maids left off running away and began calling one another back
 them and brought him a shirt and cloak
 little golden cruse of oil and told him to go wash in the stream
 to strip before a number of goodlooking young women
 live in heaven have this man sent to the phaeacians
 saw him i thought him plain but now his appearance is like that the gods who dwell in heaven
 just like this and if not im going away
 meanwhile nausicaa bethought her of another matter
 but be sure and do as i bid you for you seem to be a sensible person
 wait for a while until the rest of us can get into the town and reach my fathers house
 into the town and ask the way to the house of my father alcinous
 and you would get home quickly
 you can gain her over you may hope to see your own country again no matter how distant it may be
  she said that she was the one who left the river
 the mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down the road
 and be hospitably received by the phaecians
     book vii  thus then did ulysses wait and pray but the girl drove on to town
 he was just entering the town she came to him in the likeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher
 and ulysses said   my dear will you be so kind as to show me the house of alcinous king
 i am an unfortunate foreigner in distress and do not know one in your town and country
 find the queen
 the her husband alcinous
 who was father to nausithous by periboea a woman of great beauty
 every hope of seeing your friends again and getting safely back to your home and country
  then minerva left scheria and went away over the sea
 and the cornice was of blue enamel
 one end to the other with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the house had made
 pears pomegranates and the most delicious apples
 figs also and olives in full growth
 there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year round
 gods had endowed the house of alcinous king
 but ulysses began at eleven with his petition
  pontonous then mixed wine and water and handed it round after giving every man his drinkoffering
 have had your supper just go home to bed
 and at break of day set about helping me get home
 to die if i may first be more my property my bondsmen and all the greatness of my house
  thus did he speak
 he should have escorted inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably
 did you say you had come here from beyond the sea
 far away in the sea which is called the ogygian
 cunning and powerful goddess calypso daughter of atlas
 by herself far from all neighbours human or divine
 she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine
 neptune would still be in trouble for me
 here then i got out of the water and gathered my senses together again
 where i covered myself all over with leaves and presently heaven im sorry
 i have told you the whole truth
 every human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable
 excel all others and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are
  thus did they converse
  with these words she made them all want to eat and they flocked alike crowded to the seat
 be found his way to my house from somewhere or west
 im not going to complain
 have made your oars each by his own seat leave the ship and to prepare a feast
  alcinous then led the way and the others followed after while a servant went to fetch demodocus
 a little way out from land and then came on shore and went to the house of king alcinous
 leaning it up against a bearingpost
 to peg over his head and showed him where he was to feel for it his hands
 side and a cup of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed
 the will of jove fell both danaans and trojans
 alcinous who was sitting near him and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving
  with these words i have led the way and the others followed after
 halios and clytoneus competed also
  the foot races came first
 starting post and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew forward at the same moment
 at something and banish all sorrow from your mind
 will not be long delayed for the ship is already drawn into the water and the crew is found
  ulysses answered laodamas why do you taunt me in this way
 be much of the athlete about you
 as a god but his good looks are not crowned with discretion
 is your case no god could make a finer looking fellow than you are but you are a fool
 the place where it had fallen
 up to that throw if you can and i will throw another disc as heavy or even heavier
 to host his family at any game especially when he is in a foreign country
 achaeans were before troy and in practice
 can throw a dart farther than any else can shoot an arrow
 have left his lyre at my house just run some one or other of you and fetch it for him
 not even a god could see them so fine and subtle were they
 i have spread the chains all over the bed
 look out and as soon as he saw him start hurried off to his house burning with love for venus
 whereas i am a cripple but my parents are blame for that not i they ought never to be begotten me
 asleep on my bed it makes me furious to look at them
 he is fair to his baggage of a daughter who is fair but not honest
  on this the gods gathered to the house of vulcan
 that he will pay you all the immortal gods
  vulcan said neptune if mars goes away without paying his damages i will pay you myself
 and must not refuse you
 with oil of ambrosia such as the immortal gods clothed her in raiment of the most enchanting beauty
  thus sang the bard and both ulysses and the seafaring phaeacians they were listening to him
  then alcinous told laodamas and halius to dance alone for there was no one to compete with them
 astonished as i saw them
  thus did he speak
 they sent their servants to fetch the presents
 alcinous i will give you the stranger all the satisfaction you require
 you have given me along with your apology
 he has served the bath and washed himself
 one of the bearingposts supporting the roof if the cloister and admired him as she saw him pass
 do not forget me when youre safe at home again that you owe ransom for having saved your life
  when i have said this i have seated himself beside alcinous
 then served and the wine was mixed for drinking
  the servant carried the pork in his fingers over to demodocus who he was very pleased
 exp
 tale aright i will tell you all the world how magnificently have you endowed you
 fortress and it stood there while they sat in council round it and they were in three minds
 the horse and sacked the town breaking out from their ambuscade
 nevertheless by minervas help he was victorious
  all this he told but ulysses was overcome as he heard him and his cheeks were wet with tears
 in great trouble so let the bard leave off that we may all enjoy ourselves hosts and guest alike
 our ships may shape their purpose accordingly and take you there
 neptune was angry with us for being too easygoing in the matter of giving people escorts
  and now tell me and tell me true
 in what countries have you traveled
 are made unhappy on hearing about the return of the argive danaans from troy
 in order that future generations might have something to sing about
 did you lose some brains kinsman of your wifes when you were before troy
 a man has outside his own flesh and blood
 kindlynatured comradefor a good friend is as dear as a man his own brother
 of laertes reknowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety so that my fame ascends to heaven
 all the way up to the sunset while the others lie away from it towards dawn
 men and my eyes know none that they better love to look upon
 hazardous adventures which by joves will from troy
  when i had set sail thence the wind took me first to ismarus which is the city of the cicons
 to the sword
 equitably amongst us so that none could have reason to complain
 cried out for help to other cicons who lived inland
 ships and the hosts aimed at their bronzeshod spears at one another
 to take in fresh water and our crews got their midday meal on the shore near the ships
 huge monster who was then away from home shepherding his flocks
 would have nothing to do with other people but led the life of an outlaw
 resembling rather crag that stands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high mountain
 he my poor men found him ill to deal with
 his ewes and goats all in due course and then let each of them have her own young
 strainers but the other half i poured into bowls that i might drink it for his supper
 the fire and then caught sight of us whereon he said   strangers who are you
 do you sail the rovers with your hands against every man and every mans hand against you
 indeed about fearing the gods or shunning their anger
 do not care about jove or any of your blessed gods for we are ever so much stronger than they
 companions out of any regard for jove unless i am in the mood for doing so
 on shore
 they were shed upon the ground and the earth was wet with their blood
 then he tore them limb from limb and supped upon them
 sobbing and sighing where we were till morning cam
  in the end i considered it to be the best plan to do as follows
 upon the very four whom i should have chosen and i myself made five
 if you can not wait for me this way   he then took the cup and drank
 of the wine that has begged me for another bowl full
 he said to give me some more and tell me your name at once
 i want to make you happy
 present that i will make him
  as he spoke he reeled and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground
 his great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon he
 of human flesh on which i have been gorging for he was very drunk
 are you trying to kill yourself by fraud or by force
 in the end i considered that this plan would be the best
 i had to go to the end cyclops
 your visitors in your own house
  on this he groaned and cried out wings wings then the old prophecy about me is coming true
 no one else neither god nor man can do
  thus did he pray and neptune heard his prayer
 to rock much larger than the first swung it aloft and hurled it with prodigious force
 little of hitting the end of the rudder
 only thought how he might destroy my ships and my comrades
 dawn appeared i bade my men on board and loose hawsers
 upon the sea iron bound with a wall that girds it
 among whom we have now come
 let blow as it chose but it was not for nothing through our own foll y
  nine days and nine nights we sail and on the tenth day our native land showed on the horizon
 we have traveled we have traveled aeolus has given him ever so much more
 and silver there is in the sack he gave him
  so they talked and evil counsels prevailed
  when we reached it we went ashore to take in water and dined hard by the ships
 what brings you here
 great pains to further you on your way home to ithaca or wherever it was that you wanted to go to
 mischief for you if you will
 you come here as one abhorred of heaven
 im sorrowing from his door
 out what kind of people the inhabitants were
 for some god we have been there for two days and two nights worn out in body and mind
 in front of the ship i called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them
 feasted their eyes upon him sufficiently they washed their hands and began to cook him for dinner
 no idea where the sun or sets or rises so that we do not even know east from west
 try and find one
 tails fawned upon them and rubbed their noses lovingly against them
 who suspected mischief and stayed outside
 just as pigs do they are the same as before remembered everything
 happened to the others
 i stayed in the house but i stayed where i was
 there might be some treachery
 i have not been there for a long time
 for them
  with this i left the ship and went up inland
 pigsties like so many wild boars in their lairs
 fancy that you can set them free
 get back and will have to stay there with the rest of them
 mind i will protect you and get you out of your difficulty
  and i will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that circe will try to practice upon you
 milk the gods call it moly and mortal men can not uproot it but the gods can do whatever they like
 without its charming me she struck she struck me with her wand
 there now she cried be off to the pigsty and make your lair with the rest of them
 eat
  so she swore at eleven as i had told her and when she had completed i went to bed with her
  meanwhile her four servants who are her housemaids set about their work
 holy waters that run down into the sea
 purple cloth over a seat and laid a carpet underneath it
 tables of silver up to the seats and set them with baskets of gold
 i have already sworn solemnly that i will not hurt you
 all your ships gear and property in some cave and come back here with your men
 they had got back to their own rugged ithaca where they had been born and bred
 ulysses with them
 it was all through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives
 face and knew one another they wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole palace rang again
 but when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days sir its time
  so did they speak and i assented
 you made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage
 even in death but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly
  i was dismayed when i heard this
 teiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself the finest in all your flocks
  it was daybreak by the time she had done speaking so she dressed me in my shirt and cloak
  even so however i did not get them away without misadventure
 our fate circe brought the ram and the ewe and we made them fast hard by the ship
 that teiresias should have a black sheep to himself the best in all my flocks
 and unburied in circes house for we had had too much else to do
 here on foot quicker than i have with my ship
  sir he answered with a groan it was all bad luck and my own unspeakable drunkenness
 when you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the aeaean island
 you have asked of me
 came the ghost of my dead mother anticlea daughter to autolycus
  then came also the ghost of theban teiresias with his golden sceptre in his hand
 why poor man have you left the light of day and come down to visit the dead in this sad place
 your sword that i may drink of the blood and answer your questions truly
  you want to know said he about your return home but heaven will make this hard for you
 of neptune who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having blinded his son
 token which cannot escape your notice
 to an the gods in heaven one after the other
  mother said i i was forced to come here to consult the ghost of the theban prophet teiresias
 you have a long illness or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy passage to eternity
 and telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed
 about your never having come home and suffers more and more as he grows older
  then i tried to find some way of embracing my mothers ghost
 about the blood and i considered how i might question them severally
 her told me her race and lineage
  the first i saw was tyro
 of cretheus the son of aeolus
 who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world
 go home but hold your tongue and do not tell any one
 was a great breeder of sheep and lived in iolcus but the other lived in pylos
 pheres and amythaon who was a mighty warrior and charioteer
  then i saw chloris whom neleus married for her beauty having given priceless presents for her
 of iasus and king of minyan orchomenus and was queen in pylos
 thus then was the will of jove accomplished
  after her i saw iphimedeia wife of aloeus who boasted the embrace of neptune
 lived
  i also saw maera and clymene and hateful eriphyle who sold her own husband for gold
  what do you think of this man o phaecians
 looking and is he not clever
 you share in the distinction
  the thing shall be done exclaimed alcinous as surely as i still live and reign over the phaeacians
 all and mine above all others as the chief person among you
 how did you come by your death said i king agamemnon
 killed her close beside me
  be sure therefore continued agamemnon and not be too friendly even with your own wife
 well yourself
 the rest
 penelope is a very admirable woman and has an excellent nature
 left her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for troy
 but now tell me and tell me true can you give me any news of my son orestes
 with menelaus for i presume that he is still living
  and i said agamemnon why do you ask me
 your son is alive or dead and it is not right to talk when one does not know
 it so much to heart even if you are dead
 the wars and will he be a great soldier or is this not so
 always first to speak and his judgement was unerring
 trojan prisoners and minerva were the judges
 to lose such a tower of strength as you were to us
  and i saw tityus son of gaia stretched upon the plain and covering some nine acres of ground
  and i saw sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone with both his hands
 round him like scared birds flying all whithers
 he might would never be able to make another like it
 to row at first but presently a fair wind sprang up
 away from the others while she reclined by my side and asked me all about our adventures
 who enchant all who come near them
 of dead mens bones lying all around with the flesh still rotting off them
 if you beg and pray the men to unloose you then they must bind you faster
  of these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a dark cloud
 not even in summer and early autumn
 in full leaf grows upon it] and under it lies the sucking whirlpool of charybdis
 extreme rude cruel and invincible
  here she ended and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven whereon she returned inland
 tightly still
 wax and cut it up small with my sword
  come here they sang renowned ulysses honour to the achaean name and listen to our two voices
 me
 and exhorted them man by man not to lose heart
 now therefore let us all do as i say trust in jove and row on with might and main
 strict instructions i put on my armour
 when it is boiling over upon a great fire and the spray reached the top of the rocks on either side
 bottom of the whirlpool all black with sand and mud and the men were at their wits ends for fear
 that i saw throughout all my voyages
 head the ship therefore away from the island
  the men were in despair at this and eurylochus at once gave me an insolent answer
  thus spoke eurylochus and the men approved his words
 obey
 day therefore i went up inland that i might pray heaven to show me some means of getting away
  meanwhile eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men listen to me said he my poor comrades
 there is none so bad as famine
 of these cows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal rods
  thus spoke eurylochus and the men approved his words
  by this time my deep sleep had left me and i turned back to the ship and to the sea shore
 meat so i groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods
  sun said jove go on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over the fruitful earth
 a bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to sea
  i was told all this by calypso who said she had heard it from the mouth of mercury
 fell heavily into the sea bard by my raft on to which i then got and began to row with my hands
 and men would not let her get further sight of me otherwise i should have certainly been lost
 night after night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard i would insist as follows
  every one approved of this and then they went home to bed each in his own abode
 they hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them
 he sacrificed a bull for them in honour of jove who is the lord of all
  thus did he speak
 agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably
 take my leave be happy in this house with your children your people and with king alcinous
 fell into a deep sweet and almost deathlike slumber
 it were the neck of a stallion and a great wave of dark blue water seethed in her wake
 swiftest of all birds could not have kept pace with her
 she cut her way through the water
  when the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show
 the ship drew near to land
 within it and winejars of stone and the bees hive there
 had suffered sufficiently
 be monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are
 this will astonish everybody and you can then bury their city under the mountain
 stone and drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground
 we could see the whole of her only moment ago
 what my old father used to say and now it is all coming true
 people heard this they were afraid and got ready the bulls
 aloud despairingly
  alas he exclaimed among what manner of people am i fallen
 they savage and uncivilized or hospitable and humane
 i put all this treasure and which way shall i go
 if the crew have gone off with any of them
 when he saw her and went straight up to her
 your knees and pray to you as though you were a god
 and tell me truly what land and country is this
 am i on an island or is this the sea board of some continent
 west
 means a bid island for what there is of it
 drove them off their course and we sailed on till we came hither by night
 to sidonia and i was left here in great distress of mind
  such was his story but minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand
 and put up with every mans insolence without a word
 name tell me the truth for i do not believe i am really back in ithaca
 me in all you have been saying
 got back to my own country
 the land and you will then perhaps believe me
  as she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared
 all
 carefully away and minerva set a stone against the door of the cave
 best avenge myself
 heart as on the day when we loosed troys fair diadem from her brow
 help me now as you did then and i will fight three hundred men if you goddess will be with me
  but why said ulysses did you not tell him for you knew all about it
 while others are eating up his estate
  minerva answered never mind about him i sent him that he might be well spoken of for having gone
 but is staying quite comfortably with menelaus and is surrounded with abundance of every kind
 are lying in wait for him for they mean to kill him before he can get home
 of those who are now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves
 of his hut which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be seen from far
 pigs and the herdsmans four hounds which were as fierce as wolves slept always with them
 a pair of sandals from a good stout ox hide
  on this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down
 my master to ilius the land of noble steeds to fight the trojans in the cause of kin agamemnon
 back with him and sacrificed
 bowl of ivywood and taking a seat opposite ulysses told him to begin
  fall to stranger said he on a dish of servants pork
 not one victim nor two only and they take the run of his wine for he was exceedingly rich
 the mainland is as rich as he was he had as much as twenty men put together
 flocks of goats on the far end of the island and they are in the charge of excellent goatherds
 the best goat in the flock every day
 of the pigs that you see here and i have to keep picking out the best i have and sending it to them
 me who he was in case i may have met with such a person
 the other gods know but i may be able to give you news of him for i have travelled much
 you too old man for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty story
 it alone but i only wish he may come as do penelope his old father laertes and his son telemachus
 your own story tell me also for i want to know who you are and where you come from
  and ulysses answered i will tell you all about it
 you can see what the ear was for i have had trouble enough and to spare
 about farm work nor the frugal home life of those who would bring up children
 of men and ships on foreign service and i amassed much wealth
 had my pick of the spoil in the first instance and much more was allotted to me later on
 was that jove devised evil against me
 no longer face the enemy for they found themselves surrounded
 egyptians killed many of us and took the rest alive to do forced labour for them
 with him for i could not help it
 but in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the thesprotian coast
 wrought iron that ulysses had got together
 his family for ten generations so much had he left in the house of king pheidon
 this way? i know all about the return of my master
 cretans refitting his ships which had been damaged in a gale
 old man since fate has brought you to my door do not try to flatter me in this way with vain hopes
 pigs while others reap the fruit of our labour
 the swineherd who was a most equitable man then stood up to give every one his share
 some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of especial honour and ulysses was much pleased
  to this you answered o swineherd eumaeus eat my good fellow and enjoy your supper such as it is
 just as he thinks right for he can do whatever he chooses
  now the night came on stormy and very dark for there was no moon
 said he eumaeus and the rest of you when i have said a prayer i will tell you something
 still young and strong as when we got up an ambuscade before troy
 menelaus and ulysses were the leaders but i was in command also for the other two would have it so
 then he raised his head on his elbow
  my friends said he i have had a dream from heaven in my sleep
 and shirt and send you wherever you may want to go
  thus did ulysses sleep and the young men slept beside him
 shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind
 the skin of a large and well fed goat and a javelin in case of attack from men or dogs
 were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from the north wind
 you wish to find your excellent mother still there when you get back
 you had better attend to
  but pisistratus said no matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive in the dark
 his presents and put them in the chariot for us and let him say goodbye to us in the usual way
 a host who has shown him kindness
 go back now to my own country for i want to get home
  and menelaus answered telemachus if you insist on going i will not detain you
 or too rude to him
 a man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would like to stay
 is in the house and speed him when he wants to leave it
 till i can get your beautiful presents into your chariot and till you have yourself seen them
 store room not alone but helen went too with megapenthes
 you with the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house
 made me a present of it in the course of a visit that i paid him while i was on my return home
  so saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly
 then pisistratus put the presents into the chariot and admired them all as he did so
 into the house and they both of them sat down to table
 the meat and gave them each their portions while megapenthes poured out the wine
  we will be sure sir answered telemachus to tell him everything as soon as we see him
 it came quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands in front of the horses
 their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and darkness was over all the land
 lived who was son of ortilochus the son of alpheus
 the night and were treated hospitably
 rosyfingered dawn appeared they again yoked their horses and their places in the chariot
 under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court
 angry
 on board the ship and let us set out home
  thus did he speak and they went on board even as he had said
 where it was ordained that he should reign over much people
 he married established himself and had two famous sons antiphates and mantius
 his sons were alcmaeon and amphilochus
 melampus was father to polypheides and cleitus
 his father and went to live in hyperesia where he remained and prophesied for all men
 me also of your town and parents
  telemachus said i will answer you quite truly
 and my father is ulysses as surely as that he ever lived
 has come to some miserable end
 got my crew together to see if i can hear any news of him for he has been away a long time
  i too answered theoclymenus am an exile for i have killed a man of my own race
 have great power among the argives
 their hands and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the earth
 that they may not kill me for i know they are in pursuit
  i will not refuse you replied telemachus if you wish to join us
 to what we have
  on this he received theoclymenus spear and laid it down on the deck of the ship
 sit beside him then the men let go the hawsers
 to catch hold of the ropes and they made all haste to do so
 fresh and strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible
 thus then they passed by crouni and chalcis
  presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land
 made a quick pass sage to pheae and thence on to elis where the epeans rule
 within himself whether he should escape death or should be taken prisoner
 give me your advice therefore and let me have a good guide to go with me and show me the way
 as i needs must to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread
 news of her husband to queen penelope
 the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner
 of ways
  the swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this
 help me he exclaimed what ever can have put such a notion as that into your head
 certainty for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens
 would never think of taking a man like you for a servant
 dead and in the house of hades
 for her son may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me come to such an end as she did
 they sent ctimene to same and received a splendid dowry for her
 heaven to prosper my work in the situation which i now hold
 what will keep servants in a good humour
 is divided between these two
 man comparable to the gods reigned over both
 seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from and on this she told him her fathers name
 and am daughter to arybas a man rolling in wealth
 they are both alive and are said to be well off
 gold as i can lay my hands on and there is something else also that i can do towards paying my fare
 man of the house a funny little fellow just able to run about
  on this she went back to the house
  then theoclymenus said and what my dear young friend is to become of me
 shall i go straight to your own house and to your mother
 in heaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes place
  as he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand a hawk apollos messenger
 them off fell to the ground midway between telemachus and the ship
 on this theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand
  i wish it may prove so answered telemachus
  the words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the door
 wine fell from his hands as he made towards his master
 his head and both his beautiful eyes and wept for joy
 i heard you had gone to pylos i made sure i was never going to see you any more
 what the suitors are doing
  as spoke he took telemachus spear whereon he crossed the stone threshold and came inside
 entered but telemachus checked him sit down stranger
 i can easily find another seat and there is one here who will lay it for me
 in bowls of ivywood and took his seat facing ulysses
 bring him to ithaca and who were they
 here by land   to this you answered o swineherd eumaeus my son i will tell you the real truth
 traveller
 and has refuge at my station so i will put him into your hands
 whatever you like with him only remember that he is your suppliant
  i am very much distressed said telemachus by what you have just told me
 and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me
  then ulysses said sir it is right that i should say something myself
 god set your people against you
 for it is to these that a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be
  and telemachus answered i will tell you truly everything
 jove has made us a race of only sons
 arceisius and ulysses only son of laertes
 of ulysses who left me behind him when he went away so that i have never been of any use to him
 the issue however rests with heaven
 go at once and tell penelope that i am safe and have returned from pylos
 any one else know for there are many who are plotting mischief against me
  mores the pity answered telemachus i am sorry for him but we must leave him to himself just now
 to send one of her women secretly with the news at once and let him hear it from her
 him well off the station and then came up to it in the form of a woman fair stately and wise
 did not bark but went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards
 whereon he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the yards
 not be long in joining you for i too am eager for the fray
  as she spoke she touched him with her golden wand
 went away and ulysses came back inside the hut
 when he saw him and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking upon a god
  stranger said he how suddenly you have changed from what you were a moment or two ago
 is not the same
 heaven
 and offerings of wrought gold
  and ulysses said i am no god why should you take me for one
 am your father on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the hands of lawless men
 were old and all in rags and now you are like some god come down from heaven
  ulysses answered telemachus you ought not to be so immeasurably astonished at my being really here
 will come hereafter
 and much hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country
  as he spoke he sat down and telemachus threw his arms about his father and wept
 you cannot have come by land
  i will tell you the truth my son replied ulysses
 phaeacians who brought me here
 the habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts
 their number that i may learn who and how many they are
 only nor twice ten but ten many times over you shall learn their number at once
 two men who can carve at table
 may have bitter cause to rue your coming and your revenge
 you cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and help us
 home early tomorrow morning and go about among the suitors as before
 later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a miserable old beggar
 think however the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us
 to that later on if you really have some sign from jove that he will support you
 the house with its outbuildings and went back to his pigs again
 the first to speak
 have told them or else they saw the ship go by and could not overtake her
  on this they rose and went to the water side
  good heavens said he see how the gods have saved this man from destruction
 let us consider how we can make an end of him
 it we must see that they do us no hurt nor drive us from our own country into exile
 away from the town or on the road hither
 property amongst us and let his mother and the man who marries her have the house
  they all held their peace until amphinomus rose to speak
 kill one who is of noble blood
  then penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors
 death of telemachus and take no heed of suppliants whose witness is jove himself
 another
 doing so and stop the others also
 him from the gods he cannot escape it
 but in reality he was plotting against telemachus
  then penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till minerva shed sleep over her eyes
  telemachus was the first to speak
 said he
 or are they still waiting over yonder to take me on my way home
  i did not think of asking about that replied eumaeus when i was in the town
 as i could
 it was the suitors but i cannot be sure
  on hearing this telemachus smiled to his father but so that eumaeus could not see him
 of my own and cannot be burdened with other people
 him angry so much the worse for him but i like to say what i mean
 and call of a master
 thin and this frosty morning i shall be perished with cold for you say the city is some way off
  nurse euryclea saw him long before any one else did
 like diana or venus and wept as she flung her arms about her son
 of your having gone off to pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining my consent
 i must now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has come back with me from pylos
 piraeus to take him home and look after him till i could come for him myself
 through the town to the place of assembly whereon telemachus at once joined them
 wish you would send some of your women to my house to take awa the presents menelaus gave you
  we do not know piraeus answered telemachus what may happen
 i shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents
  with these words he took theoclymenus to his own house
 got there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats went into the baths and washed themselves
 them and had given them cloaks and shirts they took their seats at table
 bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house
  i will tell you then truth replied her son
 he sent me therefore with a chariot and horses to menelaus
 i saw helen for whose sake so many both argives and trojans were in heavens wisdom doomed to suffer
 lion and then go off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell
 nor deceive you but what the old man of the sea told me so much will i tell you in full
  with these words he moved the heart of penelope
 when i was on the ship which meant this and i told telemachus about it
  thus did they converse
 is not a bad thing at dinner time
 it is now broad day it will be night again directly and then you will find it colder
  i know and understand you replied ulysses you need say no more
 this had been made by ithacus neritus and polyctor
 and ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language which made ulysses very angry
  there you go cried he and a precious pair you are
 brings birds of the same feather to one another
 swineherd are you taking this poor miserable object
 any one sick to see such a creature at table
 house he will get his head broken by the stools they will fling at him till they turn him out
  then melanthius the goatherd answered you illconditioned cur what are you talking about
 and take you to a foreign country where i can sell you and pocket the money you will fetch
 brought him a portion of meat and an upper woman servant set bread before him that he might eat
 of the swineherds hand and said   eumaeus this house of ulysses is a very fine place
 far you go you will find few like it
 on after another
 first and join the suitors leaving me here behind you or will you wait here and let me go in first
 may you loitering about outside and throw something at you
 this matter i pray you
  and ulysses answered i understand and heed
 me here where i am
 thrown at me
 that i am casehardened and this too may go with the rest
  as they were thus talking a dog that had been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up his ears
 bred before setting out for troy but he had never had any work out of him
  this hound answered eumaeus belonged to him who has died in a far country
 would soon show you what he could do
 the forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks
 him bread from the breadbasket
 the bard was singing and had just finished his dinner as he left off
 to right and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real beggar
 but i know nothing about the man himself nor where he comes from
  on this antinous began to abuse the swineherd
 he cried what have you brought this man to town for
 tramps and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat
  and eumaeus answered antinous your birth is good but your words evil
 see this stranger turned out of the house
 and give it him yourself i do not grudge it i bid you take it
  what do you mean telemachus replied antinous by this swaggering talk
 not come here again for another three months
 of roving robbers to egypt it was a long voyage and i was undone by it
 longer face the enemy for they found themselves surrounded
 thence i am come hither in a state of great misery
  then antinous said what god can have sent such a pestilence to plague us during our dinner
 words he threw a footstool at him and hit him on the right shoulderblade near the top of his back
 did not even stagger him but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his revenge
 laying his wellfilled wallet at his feet
  listen to me he cried you suitors of queen penelope that i may speak even as i am minded
  sit where you are and eat your victuals in silence or be off elsewhere shouted antinous
 foot through the courts and the servants shall flay you alive
  thus said the suitors but antinous paid them no heed
 for they mean nothing but mischief but i hate antinous like the darkness of death itself
 house for sheer want
 in his wallet but antinous has hit him on the right shoulderblade with a footstool
 much and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband
  call him here then said penelope that i too may hear his story
 can stand such recklessness for we have now no ulysses to protect us
 revenge
  as she spoke telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house resounded with it
 go and call the stranger did you not hear how my son sneezed just as i was speaking
 to be killed and that not one of them shall escape
 of that to fill your belly by begging about the town and letting those give that will
  i will tell penelope answered ulysses nothing but what is strictly true
 in affliction but i am afraid of passing
 suitors for their pride and insolence reach heaven
 till sundown
  to this you answered o swineherd eumaeus the stranger is quite reasonable
 one else would do
  when she had done speaking eumaeus went back to the suitors for he had explained everything
 jove bring them to a bad end before they do us a mischief
 to amuse themselves with singing and dancing for it was now getting on towards evening
 soon as he came he began to insult ulysses and to try and drive him out of his own house
  be off old man he cried from the doorway or you shall be dragged out neck and heels
 tramp as myself but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and by
 incense me and old though i am i shall cover your mouth and chest with blood
 not come to the house of ulysses any more
  irus was very angry and answered you filthy glutton you run on trippingly like an old fishfag
 about you and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boars tusks
 look on
 than yourself
 the stranger and irus have quarreled and are going to fight let us set them on to do so at once
  the suitors all came up laughing and gathered round the two ragged tramps
 however that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour irus and secure him the victory
 strikes you will have to fight more than one
 chiefs antinous and eurymachus both of them men of understanding are of the same mind as i am
 and draw out your entrails for the dogs to eat
 he propped him up against the wall and put his staff in his hands
 to king echetus who kills every one that comes near him
 out of the breadbasket and brought them to him pledging him as he did so in a golden goblet of wine
 stranger you are very badly off at present but i hope you will have better times by and by
 i have heard your father well spoken of he is nisus of dulichium a man both brave and wealthy
 appear to be a considerable person listen therefore and take heed to what i am saying
 their being upon earth
 did not escape destruction for minerva had doomed him fall by the hand of telemachus
 he had come
 like also to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything more to do with them
 i am in the cloister i am not going among the men alone sera not be proper for me to do so
  on this the old woman went out of the room to bid the maids go to their mistress
 grace and beauty over her that all the achaeans might admire her
 the maids came in from the womens room and woke penelope with the sound of their talking
 became so desperately enamoured of her that each one prayed he might win her for his own bed fellow
 has been going on and how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully illtreated
 while a suppliant in our house
 to you
  thus did they converse
 my affairs i should both be more respected and show a better presence to the world
 which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me
 at fighting from chariots and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner than this
 me back to you or whether i may not fall over there at troy
 meantime do you look after things here
 true
 which i detest for jove has taken from me all hope of happiness
 this further grief moreover cuts me to the very heart
 are not wooing me after the custom of my country
  the others applauded what antinous had said and each one sent his servant to bring his present
 and lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered
 made brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it
 immediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads that gleamed like sunlight
  then the queen went back to her room upstairs and her maids brought the presents after her
 dancing and stayed till evening came
 morning but shall not beat me for i can stand a great deal
  poor wretch said she are you gone clean out of your mind
 and sleep in some smithy or place of public gossips instead of chattering aqu
 so many of them too
 do you always babble in this way
  with these words he scared the women and they went off into the body of the house
 as he said
 that i may speak even as i am minded
 build a stone fence or plant trees
 round and will find you in shoes and clothing
 and think yourself a great man because you live in a little world ind that a bad one
 his house are wide but you will find them narrow when you try to fly through them
  eurymachus was furious at all this
 wretch i will soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me and in public too
 you always babble in this way
 you beat the tramp irus
 but ulysses sought protection at the knees of amphinomus of dulichium for he was afraid
 a beggar if such ill counsels are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at our banquet
  on this telemachus came forward and said sirs are you mad
 you not carry your meat and your liquor decently
 has possessed you
 have had your suppers and the sooner you all go home to bed the better
 neither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any of ulysses servants
 we may make them and go home to our rest
 us leave telemachus to deal with him for it is to his house that he has come
 he said to telemachus telemachus we must get the armour together and take it down inside
 why you have removed it
 all smirched with soot during my own boyhood
 where the smoke cannot reach it
 store room? the maids would have so but you would not let them
  euryclea did as she was told and bolted the women inside their room
 down from heaven
  hush answered ulysses hold your peace and ask no questions for this is the manner of the gods
 here to talk with your mother and the maids
 will ask me all sorts of questions
 outside and eat your supper there or you shall be driven out with a firebrand
  ulysses scowled at her and answered my good woman why should you be so angry with me
 and parents
  madam answered ulysses who on the face of the whole earth can dare to chide with you
 weeping and wailing in another persons house nor is it well to be thus grieving continually
 yourself complaining of me and saying that my eyes swim with tears because i am heavy with wine
 affairs i should be both more respected and should show a better presence to the world
 which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me
 invent stratagems in order to deceive them
 if he is laid out without a pall
 any further shift for getting out of this marriage
 as regards your question i will tell you all you ask
 there cnossus where minos reigned who every nine years had a conference with jove himself
 for deucalion had two sons idomeneus and myself
 god had raised it for them but on the thirteenth day the wind dropped and they got away
  madam answered ulysses it is such a long time ago that i can hardly say
 and went elsewhither but i will tell you as well as i can recollect
 welcome him home again
 for that detested city whose very name i cannot bring myself even to mention
 of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here
 and make him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets that he may be warm and quiet till morning
 him again that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with telemachus
 who is uncivil to him like it or not he shall have no more to do in this house
 i will lie as i have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto
 after night have i passed in any rough sleeping place and waited for morning
 is very feeble now but she shall wash your feet
 godfearing than yourself and yet jove hates you
 he used to burn the thigh bones of goats and kids to him so he took pleasure in his companionship
 gone to ithaca and had found the child of his daughter just born
  my child answered euryclea what are you talking about
 very well that nothing can either bend or break me
 talking to him and said   stranger i should like to speak with you briefly about another matter
 it is indeed nearly bed time for those at least who can sleep in spite of sorrow
 that i have had and interpret it for me if you can
 geese about the house that eat mash out of a trough and of which i am exceedingly fond
 perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human voice and told me to leave off crying
 of icarius this is no dream but a vision of good omen that shall surely come to pass
 i looked out i saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual
 death of the suitors is portended and not one single one of them will escape
 two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies proceed el nico is of horn and the other ivory
 of ivory are fatuous but those from the gate of horn mean something to those that see them
 but even so i doubt not that i shall remember it in my dreams
 permanently without sleep and heaven has appointed us dwellers on earth a time for all things
 and there is this further difficulty which is still more considerable
 in all your troubles
  as she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes and then went back to olympus
 and fed them on cheese honey and sweet wine
  thus did he pray
 up among the from the splendour of olympus and ulysses was glad when he heard it
 hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another sign
 wheat and barley which are the staff of life
  do not find fault child said euryclea when there is no one to find fault with
 liked your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and he said he would not
 also came up and began chopping firewood
 from the fountain and the swineherd came after them with the three best pigs he could pick out
 gatehouse and then melanthius began gibing at ulysses
 here stranger said he to pester people by begging about the house
 why can you not go elsewhere
 before we have given each other a taste of our fists
 any sense of decency are there not feasts elsewhere among the achaeans as well as here
  ulysses made no answer but bowed his head and brooded
 man philoetius joined them who was bringing in a barren heifer and some goats
 to take people over when any one comes to them
 his heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse and then went up to the swineherd
 that is lately come here
 where does he come from
 jove of all gods you are the most malicious
 yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions
 already dead and in the house of hades then alas
  and in like manner eumaeus prayed that ulysses might return home
  thus did they converse
 this plot of ours to murder telemachus will not succeed djanos ir to dinner instead
  the others assented so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the benches and seats
 the heifer and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round
 they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them
 your wine among the great people
 hands and your tongues to yourselves or there will be mischief
 had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now
  thus spoke antinous but telemachus heeded him not
 there happened to be among them a ribald fellow whose name was ctesippus and who came from same
 paying court to the wife of ulysses and said to the suitors hear what i have to say
 and said unhappy men what is it that ails you
  thus did he speak and they all of them laughed heartily
 then said this stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses
 servants turn him out into the streets since he finds it so dark here
  but theoclymenus said eurymachus you need not send any one with me
 of an understanding mind
 mares that he had lost and the mule foals that were running with them
 a chest that contained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as prizes
 dreams
 bow but antinous scolded them
 simpletons why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying in this way
  then telemachus spoke
 robbed me of my senses
 contest has been agreed upon let it go forward
 whose peer is not to be found in pylos argos or mycene nor yet in ithaca nor on the mainland
 need have i to speak in praise of my mother
 excuses for delay but let us see whether you can string the bow or no
 a row in a long groove which he had dug for them and had wade straight by line
  alas
 stronger than i make trial of the bow and get this contest settled
 said   come on each of you in his turn going towards the right from the place at which the
 wine
  the rest agreed and leiodes son of oenops was the first to rise
 he was sacrificial priest to the suitors and sat in the corner near the mixingbowl
 was indignant with the others
 intolerable it makes me angry to listen to you
 bow take the life of many a chief among us merely because you cannot bend it yourself
 are others who will soon string it
 us warm the bow and grease it we will then make trial of it again and bring the contest to an end
  melanthius lit the fire and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside eso
  then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together and ulysses followed them
 do to side with the suitors or with ulysses
  father jove answered the stockman would indeed that you might so ordain it
 see with what might and main i would fight for him
 last in the twentieth year i am come back to my own country
 two therefore will i unfold the truth as it shall be
 will now give you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured
 doors of the outer court and to bind them securely at once
  when he had thus spoken he went back to the house and took the seat that he had left
  it shall not be so eurymachus said antinous and you know it yourself
 can string a bow on such a day as this
 who has just spoken with so much reason
 and leave the matter to the gods but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will
 when he was staying with peirithous among the lapithae
  penelope then spoke to him
 that you should illtreat any guest of telemachus who comes to this house
 bow of ulysses can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make me his wife
 his mind none of you need let that disturb his feasting sera be out of all reason
 will be said and it will be a scandal against us
 talk as you think they will
 he says moreover that he is of noble birth
 let us see whether he can string it or no
 and will see him sent safely whereever he wants to go
 a mans matter and mine above all others for it is i who am master here
  she went wondering back into the house and laid her sons saying in her heart
 she mourned her dear husband till minerva sent sweet sleep over her eyelids
 are you out of your wits
 our prayer your own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place and worry you to death
  euryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the womens apartments
  meanwhile philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer court
 to prove the string and it sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering of a swallow
  your guest has not disgraced you telemachus
 i aimed at and i was not long in stringing my bow
 and not as the suitors twit me with being
 to the ground at his feet and said the mighty contest is at an end
 i will now see whether apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark which no man has yet hit
 would think that one man however brave would stand alone among so many and kill him
 so that the bread and roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to the ground
  dogs did you think that i should not come back from troy
 cod nor man and now you shall die
  if you are ulysses said he then what you have said is just
 have done much wrong on your lands and in your house
 who was the head and front of the offending lies low already
 all his doing
 death which was his due spare the lives of your people
 everything good among ourselves and pay you in full for all that we have eaten and drunk
 twenty oxen and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened
 your being enraged against us
 fight or fly for your lives and fly not a man of you shall
 he is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us
 us then show fight draw your swords and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows
 his table
  father let me bring you a shield two spears and a brass helmet for your temples
 armour for the swineherd and the stockman for we had better be armed
  telemachus did as his father said and went off to the store room where the armour was kept
 four brass helmets with horsehair plumes
 and guard it for only one person could attack it at a time
 shouted out cannot some one go up to the trap door and tell the people what is going on
 make an end of this man and his shooting
 one brave man could prevent any number from getting in
  on this the goatherd melanthius went by back passages to the store room of ulysses house
 helmets and spears and brought them back as fast as he could to give them to the suitors
 the suitors putting on their armour and brandishing their spears
 of the women who is doing this or whether as i suspect it is melanthius the son of dolius
  thus did they converse
 of oceanus and it is time for you to be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast on
 daughter minerva came up to them having assumed the voice and form of mentor
 me your help and forget not your old comrade nor the many good turns he has done you
 first to reproach her
 you into siding with him and fighting the suitors
 will do when we have killed these people father and son we will kill you too
  this made minerva still more furious so she scolded ulysses very angrily
 what they were when you fought for nine long years among the trojans about the noble lady helen
 it was through your stratagem that priams city was taken
 doors unsupported
 your spears first and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by killing him
 others
  they threw their spears as he bade them but minerva made them all of no effect
  they therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears
 ulysses killed demoptolemus telemachus euryades eumaeus elatus while the stockman killed pisander
 the cloister another went against the door while the pointed shaft of another struck the wall
 of suitors
 polybus
 on the rafter held up her deadly aegis and the hearts of the suitors quailed
 maddened by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their longest
 brains were being battered in and the ground seethed with their blood
 in your house either in word or deed and i tried to stop the others
 i saw them but they would not listen and now they are paying for their folly
 near towards the trap door and held his lyre in his hand
 it afterwards if you kill a bard who can sing both for gods and men as i can
 kind of inspiration
 do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off
  telemachus heard him and at once went up to his father
 up one against the other
  then ulysses said to telemachus call nurse euryclea i have something to say to her
  telemachus went and knocked at the door of the womens room
 haste said he you old woman who have been set over all the other women in the house
 in the house have misconducted themselves and who are innocent
  i will tell you the truth my son answered euryclea
 misbehaved and have been wanting in respect to me and also to penelope
 help you
 and seats
  on this the women came down in a body weeping and wailing bitterly
 first they carried the dead bodies out and propped them up against one another in the gatehouse
 them do their work quickly so they had to carry the bodies out
 their feet moved convulsively for a while but not for very long
  as for melanthius they took him through the cloister into the inner court
 vitals and gave them to the dogs raw and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his feet
 on your back any longer
  first light me a fire replied ulysses
 to weep for he remembered every one of them
 her feet were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her head to speak to her
 she exclaimed and see with your own eyes something that you have been wanting this long time past
  my good nurse answered penelope you must be mad
 send some very sensible people out of their minds and make foolish people become sensible
 t for you always used to be a reasonable person
 my poor husband went to that city with the illomened name
  my dear child answered euryclea i am not mocking you
 true as i tell you that ulysses is come home again
 whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister
  then penelope sprang up from her couch threw her arms round euryclea and wept for joy
 standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all round him one on top of the other
 have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and filth and looking just like a lion
  my dear nurse said penelope do not exult too confidently over all this
 is dead far away from the achaean land he will never return home again
  then nurse euryclea said my child what are you talking about
  my dear nurse said penelope however wise you may be you can hardly fathom the counsels of the gods
 of my son that i may see the corpses of the suitors and the man who has killed them
 she sat silent and as one lost in amazement
 by his side and begin talking to him and asking him questions
 i cannot even look him straight in the face
 have you consider this matter
 good will nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength holds out
  i will say what i think will be best answered ulysses
 vouchsafes us shall seem wisest
  thus did he speak and they did even as he had said
 and put their shirts on while the women got ready
 his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance
 protect her husbands property until he comes home
  this was what they said but they did not know what it was that had been happening
 and sat down opposite his wife on the seat he had left
 said he heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever yet had
 ready for me i will sleep alone for this woman has a heart as hard as iron
 nevertheless euryclea take his bed outside the bed chamber that he himself built
 upon it with fleeces good coverlets and blankets
 taking my bed from the place in which i left it
 the olive tree and left the stump standing
  when she heard the sure proofs ulysses now gave her she fairly broke down
 and kissed him
 who are the wisest of mankind
 to do wrong and she gave no thought to that sin which has been the source of all our sorrows
  then ulysses in his turn melted and wept as he clasped his dear and faithful wife to his bosom
  at last however ulysses said wife we have not yet reached the end of our troubles
 but now let us go to bed that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep
 me about the task that lies before you
 it later so it is better that i should be told at once
  my dear answered ulysses why should you press me to tell you
 still i will not conceal it from you though you will not like it
 nothing about ships nor oars that are as the wings of a ship
 gave me this certain token which i will not hide from you
  thus did they converse
 back and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed
 telemachus philoetius and the swineherd now left off dancing and made the women leave off also
 in the cloisters
  when ulysses and penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking with one another
 trouble he had himself given to other people
 and she was so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till he had ended his whole story
 for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows
  then minerva bethought her of another matter
 have at last come together take care of the property that is in the house
 nobody and ask no questions
  as he spoke he girded on his armour
 and eumaeus and told them all to put on their armour also
 did and armed themselves
 gates and sallied forth ulysses leading the way
 but minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led them quickly out of the town
 in the whirling clouds of dust all huge and hugely heedless now of your chivalry
 we ever have left off if jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us
 you
  thus he spoke and the achaeans feared no more
 the old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly and clothed you in immortal raiment
 to be contended for by the noblest of the achaeans
 death your fame achilles has not been lost and your name lives evermore among all mankind
 the days of my fighting were done
 on my return by the hands of aegisthus and those of my wicked wife
 of agamemnon and achilles were astonished at seeing them and went up to them at once
 of melaneus who lived in ithaca and had been his host so it began to talk to him
 could pick no finer body of men from any city
 answer my question for i have been your guest
 how i came to your house with menelaus to persuade ulysses to join us with his ships against troy
 resume our voyage for we had hard work to persuade ulysses to come with us
 and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework
 women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall
  then some malicious god conveyed ulysses to the upland farm where his swineherd lives
 his arrow through the iron
 and poured his arrows on the ground glaring fiercely about him
  thus did they converse in the house of hades deep down within the bowels of the earth
  i see sir said ulysses that you are an excellent gardener what pains you take with it to be sure
 a fig tree vine olive pear nor flower bed but bears the trace of your attention
 if i say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself
 you are old unsavoury and very meanly clad
 is this place that i have come to really ithaca
 ithaca and that his father was laertes son of arceisius
 seven talents of fine gold and a cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it
 i added four good looking women skilled in all useful arts and i let him take his choice
 many years is it since you entertained this guest my unhappy son as ever was
 of the sea have eaten him or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some continent
 truly for i want to know
 town and parents
 your men to ithaca
 and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left you
  i will tell you everything answered ulysses quite truly
 from alybas where i have a fine house
 who is the son of polypemon
 me off my course as i was leaving sicania and i have been carried here against my will
 the open country outside the town and this is the fifth year since ulysses left my country
 him when he left me
  a dark cloud of sorrow fell upon laertes as he listened
 we went over them all and you told me their names and what they all were
  laertes strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which his son had given him
 telemachus philoetius and eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready as soon as possible
  thus conversing the two made their way towards the house
 took laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil
 i should have killed a great many of them and you would have rejoiced to see it
  then dolius put out both his hands and went up to ulysses
 gods prosper you
 return or shall we send some one to tell her
  old man answered ulysses she knows already so you need not trouble about that
 angrily in the place of assembly and when they were got together eupeithes rose to speak
 it will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder of our sons and brothers
 in life but had rather die at once
 them before they can cross over to the mainland
  he wept as he spoke and every one pitied him
 phemius had now woke up and came to them from the house of ulysses
 did not do these things against the will of heaven
 immortal god take the form of mentor and stand beside him
 let it be as i say and do as i tell you
 or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your own heads
  this was what he said and more than half raised a loud shout and at once left the assembly
 murder of his son whereas in truth he was never to return but was himself to perish in his attempt
 fighting still further or will you make peace between them
  and jove answered my child why should you ask me
 your own arrangement that ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the suitors
 will be most reasonable arrangement
 and let peace and plenty reign
 did the same warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair
 they had all put on their armour they opened the gate and sallied forth ulysses leading the way
  then joves daughter minerva came up to them having assumed the form and voice of mentor
  laertes was delighted when he heard this
 what a day i am enjoying i do indeed rejoice at it
 are vying with one another in the matter of valour
 of ithaca she cried cease this dreadful war and settle the matter at once without further bloodshed
 but ulysses gave a great cry and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring eagle
  thus spoke minerva and ulysses obeyed her gladly
